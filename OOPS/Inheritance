# === BASIC CONCEPT ===
"""
Inheritance allows a child class to reuse properties and methods of a parent class
The parent class is also called the base or superclass
The child class is also called the derived or subclass
"""

# === ADVANTAGES ===
"""
Inheritance promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy
A child class can add new features without modifying the parent class
A child class can override parent class methods if needed
"""

# === IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===
"""
Inheritance is implemented by passing the parent class in parentheses
The super() function is used to access parent class methods or constructors
"""

# === CLASS RELATIONSHIP ===
"""
Inheritance follows an "is-a" relationship between classes,
An “is-a” relationship means that the child class represents a specialized form of the parent class.
Eg: If class B inherits from class A, then B is a type of A.

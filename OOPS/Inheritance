# === BASIC CONCEPT ===
"""
Inheritance allows a child class to reuse properties and methods of a parent class
The parent class is also called the base or superclass
The child class is also called the derived or subclass
"""

# === ADVANTAGES ===
"""
Inheritance promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy
A child class can add new features without modifying the parent class
A child class can override parent class methods if needed
"""

# === IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===
"""
Inheritance is implemented by passing the parent class in parentheses
The super() function is used to access parent class methods or constructors
"""

# === CLASS RELATIONSHIP ===
"""
Inheritance follows an "is-a" relationship between classes,
An “is-a” relationship means that the child class represents a specialized form of the parent class.
Eg: If class B inherits from class A, then B is a type of A.
"""

#  SINGLE  INHERITANCE  #
#########################

"""
Meaning : One child class inherits from exactly one parent class.
The child class can access all the public and protected members (methods and variables) of the parent class and can also define its own additional features.
